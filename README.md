This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).



## Getting Started

1. Introduction:
    * "I developed an automation platform designed to enable users to create custom workflows where actions are triggered by specific events."
2. Architecture Overview:
    * "The system is built with a React frontend that communicates with a Node.js backend. The core functionality revolves around 'zaps,' which are triggers followed by multiple actions."
3. Webhook Functionality:
    * "When users log in or sign up, they can create a zap. For instance, when a webhook is triggered by an external client, a URL is generated for our webhook server. This server captures the event and processes it."
4. Database and Event Processing:
    * "Captured events are stored in a PostgreSQL database, managed with Prisma. Simultaneously, metadata from these events is pushed to a Kafka queue, which helps in distributing the load and improves our event-handling speed by approximately 75%."
5. Worker Server:
    * "To execute the tasks, I implemented a worker server that pulls tasks from the Kafka queues, leading to a 60% reduction in task execution time, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency."
6. Current Capabilities:
    * "Currently, the platform automates email notifications and money transfers using Solana wallets, ensuring seamless transactions whenever a specific event occurs."
7. Conclusion:
    * "In summary, I was responsible for designing and developing the entire system—from the frontend and backend to the event-handling infrastructure—resulting in a highly efficient platform for automating complex tasks."

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
